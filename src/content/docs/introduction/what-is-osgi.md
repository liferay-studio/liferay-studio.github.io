title: What is OSGi
description: Liferay OSGi container
---

OSGi (**Open Service Gateway Initiative**) is a modular system and service platform for Java that forms the foundation of Liferay DXP 7.4's architecture. It provides a dynamic module system that allows for better modularity, versioning, and lifecycle management of components.

## OSGi Architecture Overview

```mermaid

    A[OSGi Framework] --> B[Modules/Bundles]
    A --> C[Lifecycle]
    A --> D[Services]
    A --> E[Security]
    B --> F[Packages]
    B --> G[Metadata]
    C --> H[Install]
    C --> I[Resolve]
    C --> J[Start]
    C --> K[Stop]
    C --> L[Update]
    C --> M[Uninstall]
```

## Key OSGi Concepts

### 1. Bundles

The fundamental unit of modularity in OSGi - a JAR file with additional metadata.

### 2. Services

The mechanism for bundles to communicate dynamically.

### 3. Lifecycle

How bundles are installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled.

### 4. Modules

The isolation mechanism that keeps bundles separate yet allows controlled interaction.

## OSGi Bundle Structure

```mermaid

    Bundle --> MANIFEST.MF
    Bundle --> JavaClasses
    Bundle --> Resources
    MANIFEST.MF --> Export-Package
    MANIFEST.MF --> Import-Package
    MANIFEST.MF --> Bundle-SymbolicName
    MANIFEST.MF --> Bundle-Version
    MANIFEST.MF --> Bundle-Activator
```

## Bundle Lifecycle in Detail

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> INSTALLED: install
    INSTALLED --> RESOLVED: resolve
    RESOLVED --> STARTING: start
    STARTING --> ACTIVE
    ACTIVE --> STOPPING: stop
    STOPPING --> RESOLVED
    RESOLVED --> UNINSTALLED: uninstall
    UNINSTALLED --> [*]

    %% Update/Refresh Paths
    RESOLVED --> INSTALLED: update
    ACTIVE --> STOPPING: update/refresh
    STOPPING --> RESOLVED: (auto)
```

### Lifecycle States Explained:

1. **INSTALLED**: Bundle is installed but cannot be used yet
2. **RESOLVED**: All dependencies are resolved, ready to start
3. **STARTING**: Transition state to ACTIVE
4. **ACTIVE**: Bundle is fully operational
5. **STOPPING**: Transition state from ACTIVE to RESOLVED
6. **UNINSTALLED**: Bundle is removed but might still be in use

## OSGi Services

Services are the primary way bundles interact in OSGi:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B1 as Bundle 1
    participant SR as Service Registry
    participant B2 as Bundle 2

    B1->>SR: Register Service
    B2->>SR: Request Service
    SR->>B2: Return Service Reference
    B2->>B1: Use Service
    B1->>SR: Unregister Service
```

## Dependency Management

OSGi uses strict dependency management through:

1. **Import-Package**: What packages a bundle needs
2. **Export-Package**: What packages a bundle provides
3. **Require-Bundle**: Direct bundle dependencies (generally discouraged)

```mermaid
graph LR
    BundleA -->|Import-Package: com.example.util| BundleB
    BundleB -->|Export-Package: com.example.util| BundleA
```

## OSGi in Liferay 7.4

Liferay 7.4 uses OSGi as its core modularization technology:

1. **All core functionality** is split into OSGi bundles
2. **Custom modules** are deployed as OSGi bundles
3. **Service Builder** generates OSGi components
4. **Gogo shell** provides command-line interaction

### Liferay's OSGi Container Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph LiferayOSGi
        Framework[OSGi Framework] --> Felix[Apache Felix]
        Framework --> Equinox[Eclipse Equinox]
        Framework --> Services[Liferay Services]
        Services --> PortalService
        Services --> UserService
        Services --> ...
    end

    DeployedModules --> Framework
    ThirdPartyBundles --> Framework
```

## Bundle Development Process

1. **Create**: Develop your Java classes and components
2. **Configure**: Add OSGi metadata (MANIFEST.MF or annotations)
3. **Build**: Use Bnd or Maven to create the bundle JAR
4. **Deploy**: Copy to Liferay's deploy folder
5. **Manage**: Monitor through Gogo shell or Control Panel

## OSGi Manifest Headers

Key headers in MANIFEST.MF:

```
Bundle-SymbolicName: com.example.my.bundle
Bundle-Version: 1.0.0
Bundle-Activator: com.example.Activator
Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version="[1.8,2)"
Export-Package: com.example.util;version="1.0.0"
Service-Component: OSGI-INF/*.xml
```

## OSGi Component Model

Liferay primarily uses Declarative Services (DS):

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class MyComponent {
        +activate()
        +deactivate()
        +setService(MyService)
    }
    class MyService {
        +doWork()
    }
    MyComponent --> MyService: depends on
```

## Deployment Process in Liferay

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Bundle JAR in deploy] --> B[Liferay Detects]
    B --> C[OSGi framework installs bundle]
    C --> D[Framework resolves dependencies]
    D --> E[Bundle transitions to RESOLVED]
    E --> F[Framework calls BundleActivator.start]
    F --> G[Bundle transitions to ACTIVE]
    G --> H[Services registered]
```

## Debugging OSGi Bundles

Common tools:

1. Gogo shell commands (lb, services, bundles)
2. Liferay's Control Panel â†’ Gogo Shell
3. Felix Web Console (if installed)
4. Logs in ${liferay.home}/logs

## Best Practices

1. Use semantic versioning for bundles and packages
2. Prefer Declarative Services over BundleActivator
3. Keep bundles small and focused
4. Use proper package exports with versions
5. Avoid Require-Bundle when possible
6. Handle dynamic services properly

## Common Pitfalls

1. Missing dependencies (Unsatisfied constraints)
2. Version conflicts
3. Classloading issues
4. Service reference leaks
5. Improper lifecycle management
6. Memory leaks from unregistered services

## Advanced Topics

1. OSGi Subsystems
2. Fragment bundles
3. OSGi Remote Services
4. Configuration Admin
5. Event Admin
6. Metatype services

## Conclusion

OSGi provides Liferay 7.4 with a powerful modular architecture that enables:

- True modularity with proper isolation
- Dynamic lifecycle management
- Service-oriented architecture
- Versioned dependencies
- Better classloading

Understanding OSGi is fundamental to effective Liferay development as it underpins the entire platform's architecture.
